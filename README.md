# Hanoi Tower Search Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of the Hanoi Tower problem using search algorithms. The code in the `hanoi_tower` directory was extracted from the [intro_ia](https://github.com/FIUBA-Posgrado-Inteligencia-Artificial/intro_ia/tree/main/clase2/hanoi_tower) repository. Part of course material from Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CEIA - FIUBA).

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find the implementation of the Hanoi Tower problem using various search algorithms. The goal is to find the optimal solution to move a stack of disks from one peg to another, following the rules of the game.

## Installation

To use this code, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the `hanoi_tower` directory.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:
